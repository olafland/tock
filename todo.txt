Playground
	do rust course
	use app to start it
	toggle LED when timer expires
	read temp sensor
	print on denug when read done
	later: tx with advertisement

Futures
* wait to temp sensors
* wait for timers
* wait for rx via radio
* wait for tx done via radio
* wait for uart rx
* wait for uart tx done
* wait for button pressed
* SD card?

repeat: wait for timer -> wait for temp sensor -> tx over radio as advertisement
as futures


Low power modes
* check that nrf uses all the low-power modes as possible

Tickless design?

replace nrf softdevice on hail
* listen to uart
	on rx -> send to radio
[* listen to radio
	on rx -> send to uart]
