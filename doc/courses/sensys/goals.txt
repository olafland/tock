At the end of the SenSys 2017 tutorial, attendees should be able to:

1) Set up a Hail/imix board, compile Tock and flash, compile applications,
   and install applications.

2) Add a new capsule to the kernel (write it, include it in the crate,
   initialize it in a boot sequence).

3) Write a system call interface to a capsule.

4) Write a new chip driver for a (chip) peripheral.
   - Maybe not, but understanding unsafe use here is important.

5) Write down/diagram what happens when a process makes a blocking
   system call (context switch, interrupt setup, wait_for, interrupt 
   handling, kernel thread, resuming process).

6a) Build two apps the communicate over 802.15.4/6lowpan/Thread (depending on
how far we get)

6b) Build app app that advertises sensor data over BLE to a phone.
