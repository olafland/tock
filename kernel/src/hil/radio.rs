//! Interface for sending and receiving IEEE 802.15.4 packets.
//!
//! Hardware independent interface for an 802.15.4 radio. Note that
//! configuration commands are asynchronous and must be committed with a call to
//! config_commit. For example, calling set_address will change the source
//! address of packets but does not change the address stored in hardware used
//! for address recognition. This must be committed to hardware with a call to
//! config_commit. Please see the relevant TRD for more details.
